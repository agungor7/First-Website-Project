              Web is composed of mostly HTML documents. Simply, you as a user send a

              request to the server and the server sends you back the
              <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> (HTML) document.

                <b>HTML elements</b> are the things that we tell to a browser
                how to display content on a web page. Some elements are OK with having
                additional values such as an anchor tag which gives us opportunity to add a
                URL to link to. We call these addional values <b>attributes</b>.

              If we think a website as a house. <b>HTML</b> would be where
              the walls are being placed. <b>CSS</b> would be its style, like the
              color of the table or walls. <b>Java</b> would be the remote contol of
              the garage door. <!-- Java files are the interactive components-->

          The "tree like structure" helps to understand the relationship
          between the elements.

                <p>My name is Ali Gungor. I have received my bachelor degree in Business Administration in 2012
                and my master degree in Technology/Industrial Management in 2014. Currently working as an
                engineering administrator but wanting to change my direction to software programming or engineering.
                I love nature and believe that we need to do a lot more to protect it not only for ourselves
                but also for the future generations.
                I believe that we can protect nature:</p>

                <p>First, by improving the infrastructure and storage solutions for sustainable energy.</p>
                <p>Second, by enlarging the number of products/vehicles that is solely
                depend on sustainable energy.</p>

                <p>My purpose of journey in programming is to become either a self driving car engineer
                or working in the field of sustainable energy by using my software skills.</p>
